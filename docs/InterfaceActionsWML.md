[narrate]
---------

Shows a message with `narrator` as speaker. All the standard keys and tags supported by [\[message\]](http://wiki.wesnoth.org/InterfaceActionsWML#.5Bmessage.5D) are available, with two exceptions:

**speaker** is always equal to `narrator`;

**image** `wesnoth-icon.png` by default, if not present.

[flash_color]
-------------

Flashes the screen with the specified color.

**red, green, blue:** RGB value specifying the color required.

[flash_screen]
--------------

As `[flash_color]`, but accepts a color name as value.

**color:** the color in which the screen will flash. Currently supported values are `white, red, green, blue, magenta, fuchsia, yellow, cyan, aqua, purple, orange, black`.

[fade_to_black]
---------------

Fades the screen to black. Use `[fade_in]` to return to normal. It is a replacement for the `{FADE_TO_BLACK}` macro.

**interval:** this key controls the slowness of the fading. Use higher values to have a slower fading, default value is 5 milliseconds.

[fade_to_black_hold]
--------------------

Fades the screen to black and then pauses. Use `[fade_in]` to return to normal. It is a replacement for the `{FADE_TO_BLACK_HOLD}` macro.

**delay:** required, it is the pause duration, in milliseconds.

**interval:** this key controls the slowness of the fading. Use higher values to have a slower fading, default value is 5 milliseconds.

[fade_in]
---------

Brings the screen back from a `[fade_to_black]` or a `[fade_to_black_hold]`. It is a replacement for the `{FADE_IN}` macro.

**interval:** this key controls the slowness of the fading. Use higher values to have a slower fading, default value is 5 milliseconds.

[fade_to_white]
---------------

Fades the screen to white. Use `[fade_in_from_white]` to return to normal. It is equivalent to a theorical `{FADE_TO_WHITE}` macro.

**interval:** this key controls the slowness of the fading. Use higher values to have a slower fading, default value is 5 milliseconds.

[fade_to_white_hold]
--------------------

Fades the screen to white and then pauses. Use `[fade_in_from_white]` to return to normal. It is equivalent to a theorical `{FADE_TO_WHITE_HOLD}` macro.

**delay:** required, it is the pause duration, in milliseconds.

**interval:** this key controls the slowness of the fading. Use higher values to have a slower fading, default value is 5 milliseconds.

[fade_in_from_white]
--------------------

Brings the screen back from a `[fade_to_white]` `[fade_to_white_hold]`. It is equivalent to a theorical `{FADE_IN_FROM_WHITE}` macro.

**interval:** this key controls the slowness of the fading. Use higher values to have a slower fading, default value is 5 milliseconds.

[animate_path]
--------------

Move an image or cycle of images along a path not restricted by the map grid.

**x, y:** required. A list of points that control the movement. Points are specified in pixels and ranges are not accepted. For most interpolation methods, the animation will pass through the listed points. Some interpolation methods require a minimum number of points be specified.

**hex\_x, hex\_y:** required. The coordinates of the hex that the x and y coordinates will be relative to. 0,0 is the centre of this hex, with positive values for x and y up and to the right.

**image:** required. The image or sequence of images to display. If the value of `frames` exceeds the number of images, the images will be displayed in a loop. The images must have a 72 pixel transparent border surrounding them to be displayed properly.

**frame_length:** required. The amount of time each image will be displayed on screen in milliseconds.

**frames:** The number of frames to use in the animation. If it is not specified, then the number of `images` from image will be used to calculate the number of frames. The number of frames must be at least 2 (so including a single image in `image` and not including this attribute will not work).

**linger:** (default: no). If yes, then the last image will remain visible after the animation completes. It may be removed using [\[remove\_item\]](http://wiki.wesnoth.org/InterfaceActionsWML#.5Bremove_item.5D).

**transpose:** (default: no). Interpolation methods marked function are normally based on the x coordinates. If this is yes, then they are based on the y coordinates. It has no effect on other interpolation methods.

**interpolation:** (default linear). The interpolation method used to travel between points. Allowed values are: `linear, bspline, parabola and cubic_spline`.

### Method Details

Methods marked (function) require that the x values (y values if `transpose` is yes) be distinct and sorted (increasing or decreasing). Currently this is not checked, provide points out of order at your own risk.

* **linear:** Animation moves in a straight line between each set of points.
* **bspline:** requires that at least 4 points be specified. Animation moves within a curve bounded by the points. It usually will not pass exactly through any point. It is currently the only method that produces curves that can form spirals or overlapping shapes.
* **parabola (function):** requires exactly 3 points be specified. The animation moves along the unique parabola that includes the specified points.
* **cubic_spline (function):** Animation moves along a curved path passing through each point. It is not possible to double back.

[unknown_message]
-----------------

Displays a message with the unknown unit icon as speaker portrait. Can team color the icon and set the caption.

**message:** required. The message to display, use exactly like in the [\[message\]](http://wiki.wesnoth.org/InterfaceActionsWML#.5Bmessage.5D) tag.

**color:** if specified, the unknown unit icon will be team colored. Supported values are `red, lightred, darkred, blue, green, purple, black, brown, orange, white, teal` or integer numeric values between `1` and `9` (enclosed).

**right:** default no, if yes the unknown unit icon will be displayed on the right side of the screen.

**caption:** the text to display as speaker's name, use like in the [\[message\]](http://wiki.wesnoth.org/InterfaceActionsWML#.5Bmessage.5D) tag.

**duration:** the minimum number of frames for the message to be displayed.

**side_for:** a comma-separated list of sides that determines which sides see the message.

**sound:** a sound effect to play as the message is shown. This can take a comma-separated list; a sound from such a list will be randomly chosen to be played.

[show_quick_debug]
------------------

When used inside a [\[set\_menu\_item\]](http://wiki.wesnoth.org/InterfaceActionsWML#.5Bset_menu_item.5D), this tag allows modifying several unit attributes using the right-click menu. It displays a dialog where you can set hitpoints, moves, etc.
